Hello,

This is my Software Engineering project: Employee Management System.

I have used Java Swing for the front end and MySQL for the database to build this application.

Key Features:
The system includes two actors: Employee and HR Manager.

### Roles of the Employee:
- Login  
- Logout  
- Mark Attendance  
- View Attendance Record  
- Request Leave  
- Check Leave Status  
- View Employee Details  

### Roles of the HR Manager:
- Login  
- Logout  
- Add Employee  
- Remove Employee  
- View Employee Details  
- Update Employee Details  
- Approve/Reject Leave Requests  
- View Employee Attendance Records  
- Update Employee Payroll

### SRS Document:
Uploaded in PDF format. It also contains a Use Case Diagram, Class Diagram, and Sequence Diagram. Can be downloaded for reference.

### Testing:
A PDF detailing the Black Box Testing strategies has been uploaded. It includes:

1. Boundary Value Analysis
  
2. Requirements Traceability Matrix
   
3. Positive & Negative Testing

White Box Testing was conducted under the supervision of our faculty.

### Deployment:
This project has not been deployed. You can run it on a local system to use it.

### Database:
I have uploaded the MySQL snippets, which you can use to set up the database on your system.

ðŸŒŸ Happy Coding! ðŸŒŸ
